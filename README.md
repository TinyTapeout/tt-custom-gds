# tt-custom-gds

Templates for submitting Custom GDS Designs to Tiny Tapeout (alpha). Please contact us before using any of these templates.

The repo includes multiple template sizes, but not all of them are currently supported by Tiny Tapeout.

Template files with _ana suffix are for designs with Analog IO pins. The other templates files only have digital I/O pins, like any standard Tiny Tapeout project.
